<h2 class="center-text">A language to help athletes express their training. Inspired by Markdown.</h2>

<h2 class="center-text">Human Centered Data</h2>
<p>The <strong>Traindown</strong> format was created first and foremost to make <em>understanding</em> what happened during a given training session easier to do by <em>humans</em> than formats such as spreadsheets, JSON, YAML, etc.</p>
<p>Humans love narratives. We see the world in terms of narratives. Why do we suffer reading something designed for computers to make sense of <em>our</em> data?</p>
<p><strong>Traindown</strong> is part of a broader movement in software to make both applications and data more human centered. Start with the person and work outward. We should never settle for &quot;it is what the computer prefers.&quot;</p>
<h2 class="center-text">Standardization of Data</h2>
<p>That all being said, <strong>Traindown</strong> is also great for computers!</p>
<p>The format is more compact than JSON, YAML, XML, etc. It is also easily output into spreadsheets as well as other training applications.</p>
<p>By standardizing how computers think about human training, we make our data portable. The goal of <strong>Traindown</strong> is to produce a common language of training data.</p>
<p>This allows for researchers to have better data for modeling in machine learning. Imagine a world where you donated your training data to help create systems that optimize training for everyone!</p>
<p>We won't have that future if everyone's data is in a proprietary formats locked away in closed systems. By starting with standardization, we make amazing things possible.</p>
<p>And for you, personally, the benefits of standardization include never being locked into one app. Imagine learning about a new app and being able to load your entire training history into it immediately!</p>
<h2 class="center-text">True Ownership of Data</h2>
<p>In order for you to have that freedom, you must be the <em>actual owner</em> of <em>your</em> data. With that ownership, you may choose to try different apps without fear of hostile developers locking your data away in <em>their</em> databases.</p>
<p>For too long, we as software users have given away <em>our</em> data in exchange for access to software. The power dynamic is vastly biased toward the Maker rather than the True Owner. With <strong>Traindown</strong>, <em>you</em> have control. <em>You</em> choose your level of sharing. In fact, that may be by not using software other than a text editor! <em>You</em> choose.</p>
<h2 class="center-text">Sound Interesting?</h2>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>I (<a href="mailto:tyler@greaterscott.com">Tyler</a>...hi!) am excited to hear what you think of <strong>Traindown</strong>.</p>
<p>I would recommend heading on over to the <a href="/guide">Guide</a> first as that will give you a real world tutorial as well as FAQs about using <strong>Traindown</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have an understanding, why not try out the <a href="/playground">Playground</a> right in your browser?</p>
<p>If you like, there is a mobile app called the <a href="/transponder">Traindown Transponder</a> that is available for both iOS and Android. Be forewarned, it is rough around the edges. I hope to have time to polish it here soon.</p>
<p>Better yet, <em>you</em> could build a better <strong>Traindown</strong> mobile application! You can write your own parser using the <a href="/spec">Spec</a> or if you prefer using a library, I have a few available on the <a href="/page">Source</a>.</p>
<p>As always, should you have any questions, comments, or feedback please don't hesitate to reach me at <a href="mailto:tyler@greaterscott.com">tyler at greaterscott dot com</a>.</p>
<p>Kick ass!</p>
